      This CRAN task view contains a list of packages that includes
methods typically used in official statistics and survey methodology.
Many packages provide functionality for more than one of the topics listed 
below.  Therefore this list is not a strict categorization and packages can be 
listed more than once. Certain data import/export facilities regarding to often used statistical software tools
like SPSS, SAS or Stata are mentioned in the end of the task view.

        <li>
          Package

          Imputation
        </strong>
      </p>
      A distinction between iterative model-based methods, k-nearest neighbor methods 
and miscellaneous methods is made.  However, often the criteria for using a 
method depend on the scale of the data, which in official statistics are 
typically a mixture of continuous, semi-continuous, binary, categorical and 
count variables. In addition, measurement errors may corrupt non-robust imputation methods.
Note that only few imputation methods can deal with mixed types of variables and only few methods account for robustness issues.

	by means of maximum likelihood (ML) or robust ML. On the basis of the estimated parameters, robust predictions of the area-specific 
	means are computed (incl. MSE estimates; parametric bootstrap).
