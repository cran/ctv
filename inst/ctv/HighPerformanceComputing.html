        This CRAN task view contains a list of packages, grouped by topic, that
      are useful for high-performance computing (HPC) with R.  In this context, we
      are defining 'high-performance computing' rather loosely as just about anything
      related to pushing R a littler further: using compiled code,
      parallel computing (in both explicit and implicit modes), working with
      large objects as well as profiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless otherwise mentioned, all packages presented with hyperlinks 
      are available from CRAN, the
      Comprehensive R Archive Network.
      </p>
      <p>
        Several of the areas discussed in this Task View are undergoing rapid
      change. Please send suggestions for additions and extensions for this task
      view to the

        <strong>
          Parallel computing: Explicit parallelism
        </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Several packages provide the communications layer required for parallel
        computing. The first packages in this area was
<a href="../packages/rpvm/index.html">rpvm</a>
            by Li and Rossini which uses the PVM (Parallel
        Virtual Machine) standard and libraries.
<a href="../packages/rpvm/index.html">rpvm</a>
            is no
        longer actively maintained.
          </li>
          <li>
            In recent years, the
        alternative MPI (Message Passing Interface) standard has become the
        de facto standard in parallel computing. It is supported in R via
  	the
<a href="../packages/Rmpi/index.html">Rmpi</a>
            by Yu.
<a href="../packages/Rmpi/index.html">Rmpi</a>
            is mature yet actively
	maintained and offers access to numerous functions from the MPI
	API, as well as a number of R-specific extensions.
<a href="../packages/Rmpi/index.html">Rmpi</a>
            can be used with the LAM, MPICH / MPICH2, Open MPI, and Deino MPI 
        implementations.
          </li>
          <li>
            An alternative is provided by the
<a href="../packages/nws/index.html">nws</a>
            (NetWorkSpaces)
        packages from REvolution Computing.  It is the successor to the
	earlier LindaSpaces approach to parallel computing, and is
	implemented on top of the Twisted networking toolkit for Python.
          </li>
          <li>
            The
<a href="../packages/snow/index.html">snow</a>
            (Simple Network of Workstations) package by
        Tierney et al can use PVM, MPI, NWS as well as direct networking
        sockets. It provides an abstraction layer by hiding the
	communications details. The
<a href="../packages/snowFT/index.html">snowFT</a>
            package provides 
        fault-tolerance extensions to
<a href="../packages/snow/index.html">snow</a>, but is no longer
        actively maintained.
          </li>
          <li>
            The
<a href="../packages/snowfall/index.html">snowfall</a>
            package by Knaus provides a more recent
	alternative to
<a href="../packages/snow/index.html">snow</a>. It is however not yet at the same level of
	maturity, and supports only the LAM implementation of the MPI
        standard.
          </li>
          <li>
            The
<a href="../packages/papply/index.html">papply</a>
            package by Currie provided a subset of the
<a href="../packages/Rmpi/index.html">Rmpi</a>
            functionality, but is no longer actively maintained either.
          </li>
          <li>
            The
<a href="../packages/biopara/index.html">biopara</a>
            package by Lazar and Schoenfeld offers socket-based parallel
        execution with some support for load-balancing and fault-tolerance.
          </li>
          <li>
            The
<a href="../packages/taskPR/index.html">taskPR</a>
            package by Samatova et al builds on top of LAM MPI and offers 
        parallel execution of tasks.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Parallel computing: Implicit parallelism
        </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The pnmath package by Tierney uses the Open MP parallel
        processing directives of recent compilers (such gcc 4.2 or later) for implicit
        parallelism by replacing a number of internal R functions with
        replacements that can make use of multiple cores --- without
        any explicit requests from the user.  The alternate
        pnmath0 package offers the same functionality using
        Pthreads for environments in which the newer compilers are not
        available.  Similar functionality is expected to become integrated
    	into R 'eventually'.
          </li>
          <li>
            The romp package was presented at the useR! 2008 conference and
        offers another interface to Open MP using Fortran; this code is
        still pre-alpha.
          </li>
          <li>
            The
<a href="../packages/fork/index.html">fork</a>
            package provides R-equivalents to low-level Unix system functions
        like fork, signal, wait, kill and exit in order to spawn
        sub-processes for parallel execution.
          </li>
          <li>
            The
<a href="../packages/multicore/index.html">multicore</a>
            package provides a way of running parallel
        computations in R on machines with multiple cores or CPUs.
          </li>
          <li>
            The R/parallel package offers a C++-based master-slave dispatch
        mechanism for parallel execution.
          </li>
          <li>
            The
<a href="../packages/RScaLAPACK/index.html">RScaLAPACK</a>
            provides an interface to the ScaLAPACK
        libraries which can replace the standard BLAS libraries
        and offer parallel execution of the same BLAS functions.

          Parallel computing: Grid computing
        </strong>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The
<a href="../packages/gridR/index.html">gridR</a>
            package by Wegener et al can be used in a grid computing
        environment via a web service, via ssh or via Condor or Globus.
          </li>
          <li>
            The multiR package was presented at useR! 2008 but has not been
        released. It may offer a snow-style framework on a grid computing platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Biocep-R project offers a Java-based framework for local, Grid,
        or Cloud computing. It is under active development.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Job-scheduling toolkits permit management of
	parallel computing resources and tasks.  The slurm (Simple Linux
        Utility for Resource Management) set of programs (written by a
        consortium led by Lawrence Livermore Labs) works well with
        MPI.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Condor toolkit from the University of Wisconsin-Madison

          <li>
            The
<a href="../packages/bigmemory/index.html">bigmemory</a>
            packages permits storing large objects such
        as matrices in memory and uses external pointer objects to refer to
        them.  This permits transparent access from R without bumping
        against R's internal memory limits.  Several R processes on the
        same computer can also shared big memory objects.

            A large number of database packages, and database-alike packages
