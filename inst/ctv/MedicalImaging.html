        <em>
          DICOM
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The industry standard format, for data coming off a clinical
    imaging device, is
        <a href="http://dicom.nema.org">
          DICOM
        </a>
        (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine).  The DICOM
    &quot;standard&quot; is very broad and very complicated.  Roughly speaking
    each DICOM-compliant file is a collection of fields organized into
    two four-byte sequences (group,element) that are represented as
    hexadecimal numbers and form a
        <em>
          tag
        </em>.  The (group,element)
    combination announces what type of information is coming next.
    There is no fixed number of bytes for a DICOM header.  The final
    (group,element) tag should be the &quot;data&quot; tag (7FE0,0010), such
    that all subsequent information is related to the image(s).

      </p>
      <p>
        Although the industry standard for medical imaging data is
    DICOM, another format has come to be heavily used in the image
    analysis community.  The
        <a href="http://www.mayo.edu/bir/PDF/ANALYZE75.pdf">
          ANALYZE
        </a>
        format was originally developed in conjunction with an image
    processing system (of the same name) at the Mayo Foundation.  An
    Anlayze (7.5) format image is comprised of two files, the &quot;hdr&quot;
    and &quot;img&quot; files, that contain information about the acquisition
    and the acquisition itself, respectively.  A more recent adaption
    of this format is known as
        <a href="http://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-1">
          NIfTI-1
        </a>
        and is a
    product of the Data Format Working Group (DFWG) from the
    Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI).  The
    NIfTI-1 data format is almost identical to the ANALYZE format, but
    offers a few improvements: merging of the header and image
    information into one file (.nii), re-organization of the 348-byte
    fixed header into more relevant categories and the possibility of
    extending the header information.

<a href="../packages/oro.nifti/index.html">oro.nifti</a>.  Data management capabilities
      include: read/write for NIfTI extensions, full audit trail,

      as follows: motion correction and/or co-registration, T1
      estimation, conversion of signal intensity to gadolinium
      contrast-agent concentration and kinetic parameter estimation.
      Parametric estimation of the kinetic parameters, from a
      single-compartment (Kety or extended Kety) model, is performed
      via Levenburg-Marquardt optimization or Bayesian estimation.
      Semi-parametric estimation of the kinetic parameters is also

          The R package

      false positive detections without, in contrast to traditional
      non-adaptive smoothing methods, reducing the effective spatial
